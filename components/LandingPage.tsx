        Short-term funding markets are the core of liquidity and maturity
        transformation in financial markets. They provide financing for
        financial institutions, serve as alternatives to deposits for cash
        investors, and can be used to obtain securities. However, as unavoidable
        consequences of their functions, these critical markets are vulnerable
        to disruptions. Problems faced by financial institutions or other parts
        of the financial system often appear as stresses in short-term funding
        markets. As part of the Office of Financial Research's mission to
        promote and monitor financial stability, the OFR collects a variety of
        data on these markets. The Short-term Funding Monitor presents these
        data and places them in context with other data sources.
